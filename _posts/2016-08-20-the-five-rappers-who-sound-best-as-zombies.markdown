When the zombie apocalypse made the beat-drops monotonous, at least a few rappers stayed on top of it. Finding good hip hop is harder than ever since everything went to shit, but there’s still hope out there: your friends here at the Zombie Apocalypse Survival Guide have come to the rescue with 5 rappers who still sound great, even if their jaws have begun to fall off. It’s probably the weight of all those grillz.

### 5. Lil Yachty
Your favorite boat found the transition from rapper to zombie rapper pretty easy. Staying on the beat is no longer an issue for him, as zombie producers are hard to come by and tend to eat each other anyway, so he’s able to focus more than ever on his trademark mumbling.

### 4. Drake
Drake has always been on top of the trends, and he jumped on the chance to have something new to lament. His brain-dead fans appreciate his take on a new slew of relatable problems--hits include “One Bite,” “Revolta,” “Started From The Living,” “10 Hands,” “Deadlines,” and many more.

### 3. MF Doom
I’ll let you in on a secret here: MF Doom made it through the zombie apocalypse A-OK (e.g. not zombified) because nobody could tell if he was alive or dead behind the mask and everyone respected him too much to question it. He’s been quietly doing his thing ever since the deadening, though he’ll tell you it’s harder than ever to find a good soundman.

### 2. Tyler, The Creator
Tyler was actually one of the first people to go full zom, but fans thought he was just bringing a frantic new energy to OFWGKTA when he abandoned lyrics entirely for his album “HHAAAAARGH.” And actually, it bangs, so maybe it was the right move. It wasn’t until he ate Frank Ocean that people started to worry, and that was mostly because they figured they might never get to listen to “Boys Don’t Cry.”

### 1. Desiigner
This one’s a real no-brainer. Some say his lyrics are actually easier to understand now that he definitely doesn’t have any, but it’s still hotly debated among hip-hop heads, brains or no. Regardless, he’s topped the charts worldwide for years, proving once and for all that nobody cares about the words.

Rappers considered: Young Thug, Desiigner, Future, Drake, Kanye, Kendrick, Murs, Atmosphere, Lupe, Action Bronson, Vince Staples, Vic Mensa, Lil Yachty, flatbush zombies, Schoolboy Q, Chance the Rapper, Allan Kingdom, Mick Jenkins, Goldlink, Big Boi, Andre 3000, Childish Gambino, Outkast, MF Doom, De La Soul, J. Cole, Lil Dicky, Nas, Sonreal, Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt
